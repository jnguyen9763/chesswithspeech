Our program is a chess game that uses speech commands to operate. We used chessboard.js and the Web Speech API 
to create the program. The program can be accessed through the following link: https://jnguyen9763.github.io/chesswithspeech/ 
and instructions on how to play are provided there as well. Some challenges with this project came mostly from using the 
Web Speech API. Because its grammar was mostly meant to decipher english speech, using coordinates for the movement had 
some difficulties. What we did to fix that was basically give two ways that the user can move. The user can say one coordinate 
at a time or say both of the coordinates at once. The game can be fully operated with speech commands after the user presses 
the "Click to Speak" button.

Our UI makes it easy for the player to see how the game works. The instructions are on the top left of the screen 
and are available for the user to see throughout the game. We also allow the user to see their previous moves and 
see the pieces that they've captured. So the player can see the status of the game as well as see what they did to 
get to the current game.
